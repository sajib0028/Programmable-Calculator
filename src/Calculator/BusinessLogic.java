 * This method deals with CalculatorValues and performs actions on them.  The class expects data
 * from the User Interface to arrive as Strings and returns Strings to it.  This class calls the
 * CalculatorValue class to do computations and this class knows nothing about the actual 
 * representation of CalculatorValues, that is the responsibility of the CalculatorValue class and
 * the classes it calls.</p>
